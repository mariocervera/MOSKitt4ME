# Moskitt4me

This repository contains the Eclipse plug-ins that implement MOSKitt4ME, a Computer-Aided

methods and also the semi-automatic construction of tools that facilitate the execution of
the methods in specific projects.

A brief introduction to MOSKitt4ME can be found in the following playlist:
