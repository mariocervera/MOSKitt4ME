# Moskitt4me

This repository contains the Eclipse plug-ins that implement MOSKitt4ME, a Computer-Aided
Method Engineering (CAME) environment. MOSKitt4ME supports the design of software development
methods (in terms of the SPEM 2.0 standard) and also the semi-automatic construction of tools
that facilitate the execution of the methods in specific projects.

A brief introduction to MOSKitt4ME can be found in the following playlist:

A more extensive description of the tool is provided in Chapter 5 of my PhD thesis:
