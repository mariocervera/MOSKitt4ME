# MOSKitt4ME



This repository contains the Eclipse plug-ins that implement the MOSKitt4ME tool. MOSKitt4ME is the result of five years of intensive research in the field of Software Development Method Engineering; specifically, MOSKitt4ME is a Computer-Aided Method Engineering (CAME) environment that offers various unique characteristics. Most notably, MOSKitt4ME not only supports the design of software development
methods (in terms of the SPEM 2.0 standard) but also the semi-automatic construction of tools (e.g., graphical editors and code generators) that facilitate the enactment of the methods in specific projects. Furthermore, MOSKitt4ME offers an integrated environment for method execution based on a workflow engine: Activiti.

A brief introduction to MOSKitt4ME can be found in the following playlist:
