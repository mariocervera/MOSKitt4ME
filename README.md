# MOSKitt4ME

This repository contains the Eclipse plug-ins that implement the MOSKitt4ME tool. MOSKitt4ME is the result of five years of intensive research in the field of Software Development Method Engineering. The result of these efforts is a Computer-Aided Method Engineering (CAME) environment that offers various unique characteristics. Most notably, MOSKitt4ME supports the design of software development methods (in terms of the SPEM 2.0 standard) and also the semi-automatic construction of tools (e.g., graphical editors and code generators) that facilitate the execution of the methods in specific projects. To support method execution, MOSKitt4ME offers an integrated environment that is built upon a workflow engine: Activiti.

The following playlist offers a brief introduction (slides + screencasts) to the MOSKitt4ME environment:
