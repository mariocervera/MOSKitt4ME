The architecture of MOSKitt4ME comprises the following components:

CAME platform (Computer-Aided Method Engineering)
------------------------------------------------------

- Method Editor: this component allows method engineers to perform the conceptual modeling of methods following the SPEM 2.0 standard.

- Repository Client: this component allows method engineers to connect to FTP repositories of conceptual and technical fragments.
By means of this client, method engineers can create new fragments and also store, retrieve, and integrate them. A
conceptual fragment is a reusable method part, such as a role, a product or a task. A technical fragment is a sofware tool,
such as a graphical editor or a code generator.

- Metatools: the metatools allow method engineers to develop tools for software development. Examples of metatools are
frameworks for the construction of graphical editors (e.g., the Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework), or languages for
the implementation of code generators and Model-to-Model transformations (e.g., Xpand and ATL).

- CASE Generator: this component is in charge of the automatic construction of the CASE platform, which provides customized software
support for the method that has been defined by means of the CAME platform.


CASE platform (Computer-Aided Software Engineering)
------------------------------------------------------

- Process Engine:  this component supports the execution of the process part of the method that was defined using the method editor.

- Project Manager: this component provides a graphical user interface that assists software engineers during the course of software
development projects.
